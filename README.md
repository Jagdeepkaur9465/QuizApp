# QuizApp
I am building an interactive quiz app.

It is an app that lets us to take quizzes and create our own. It's like a game where we can test your knowledge on different topics. Quiz App is for us. We can make our own quizzes too and challenge our friends. It's a way to have fun while learning new things.

Concepts needed to build the Application:

1.Firebase Integration:

Connecting the app to a special service called Firebase for things like keeping track of our scores and creating quizzes.
2.Android UI/UX Design:

Making the app look good and be easy to use with buttons and screens that are clear and friendly.
3.Activity Navigation:

Creating different sections in the app, like one for starting a quiz, playing the quiz, and seeing the results. Make sure we can smoothly move between these sections.
4. Firebase Realtime Database:

Using Firebase to save information about users, quizzes, and questions in a smart way so the app works smoothly.
5.Quiz Logic:

Making the app smart enough to show questions, check our answers, and calculate our score. Add a timer to make it more exciting.
